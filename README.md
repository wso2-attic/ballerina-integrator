# Ballerina Integrator


A powerful, simple-to-learn, code-driven approach to programming integrations - based on the Ballerina programming 
language (ballerina.io). It includes first-class cloud-native functions as well as a graphical sequence diagram tool. 
The Ballerina Integrator appeals to those using decentralized integration architectures, Microservices, 
and cloud-native apps.
Developers can now efficiently code integrations directly into their work, merging the worlds of development 
and integration.

## Ballerina 

Ballerina is a new general-purpose programming language that makes it easy to write cloud-native applications.

Please visit ballerina.io to find more about Ballerina. 

## Key Highlights

### Develop fast and resource-efficient integrations using code-based technology

Ballerina incorporates fundamental concepts of distributed system integration into the language and offers a type-safe, 
concurrent environment to implement microservices with distributed transactions, reliable messaging, etc.

Based on the interactions of sequence diagrams, Ballerina has built-in support for common integration patterns and 
connectors, including distributed transactions, compensation, and circuit breakers. 
With first-class support for JSON and XML, Ballerina makes it simple and effective to build robust integration 
across network endpoints.

### Cloud-native, microservices ready

The Ballerina integrator container-friendly super lightweight runtime seamlessly works with Docker, Kubernetes, 
Prometheus, and other cloud technologies. 

### Enables a true agile approach to API-centric integration
With the use of Ballerina language, the Ballerina Integrator marking a revolutionary new phase of A
PI-centric integration. As a programming language, integration developers can apply agile methodologies, 
bringing a new degree of speed and agility to integration projects. 


### Easy to learn; complete with out-of-the-box templates
