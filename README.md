A powerful, simple-to-learn, code-driven approach to programming integrations - based on the [Ballerina programming language](https://ballerina.io). It includes first-class cloud-native functions as well as a graphical sequence diagram tool.

The Ballerina Integrator appeals to those using decentralized integration architectures, microservices, and cloud-native apps.

Developers can now efficiently write code for their integration scenarios, merging the worlds of development
and integration.

## Ballerina 

Ballerina is a new general-purpose programming language that makes it easy to write cloud-native applications.

Please visit [ballerina.io](https://ballerina.io) to read more about Ballerina.

## Key Highlights

### Develop fast and resource-efficient integrations using code-based technology

Ballerina incorporates fundamental concepts of distributed system integration into the language and offers a type-safe, 
concurrent environment to implement microservices with distributed transactions, reliable messaging, etc.

Based on the interactions of sequence diagrams, Ballerina has built-in support for common integration patterns and 
connectors, including distributed transactions, compensation, and circuit breakers. 

With first-class support for JSON and XML, Ballerina makes it simple and effective to build robust integration 
across network endpoints.

### Cloud-native, microservices ready

The container-friendly super lightweight Ballerina Integrator runtime seamlessly works with Docker, Kubernetes,
Prometheus, and other cloud technologies. 

### Enables a true agile approach to API-centric integration
With the use of Ballerina language, the Ballerina Integrator marks a revolutionary new phase of API-centric integration. Using this programming language, integration developers can apply agile methodologies,
bringing a new degree of speed and agility to integration projects. 


### Easy to learn; complete with out-of-the-box templates
