# Integration Tutorials

The integration tutorials will walk you through the main capabilities and features of Ballerina Integrator in EI, and
help you understand how to use Ballerina Integrator to build an integrated system. In these tutorials, we will build an integrated
Health Care System by using the capabilities of Ballerina in WSO2 EI. Each of the tutorials in this section will
provide step-by-step instructions on how to build and test the various parts of this system until the integrated
Health Care system is complete.
