# Setup the Developer Environment

## Installing Ballerina

To download and install Ballerina, see the [Ballerina Getting Started](https://ballerina.io/learn/getting-started/) page. This includes instructions on how to download Ballerina and install its tools. It also includes system requirements and uninstall instructions.

## Setting up IDEs

You can use your [favorite editor to work on Ballerina code](https://ballerina.io/learn/tools-ides/), however, we recommend you use VS Code as we have made some improvements to it for use in integration scenarios.

Download and install [VS Code from the Visual Studio website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) if you do not have it already.

Find the extension for Ballerina in the VS Code marketplace. This extension is called `Ballerina`. For instructions on installing and using it, see [The Visual Studio Code Extension](https://ballerina.io/learn/tools-ides/vscode-plugin/).
