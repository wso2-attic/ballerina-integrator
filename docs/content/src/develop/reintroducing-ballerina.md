# Re-introducing Ballerina Programming Language

Why does the Ballerina programming language need a re-introduction? When Ballerina version 1.0 was released, it was clear that this was a platform geared towards cloud-era application programmers to easily write software that just works. The Ballerina Integrator uses the power of the language to drive a multitude of integration scenarios and empower developers to make integration simple. This page provides an overview of the language that makes it easier for developers to write their code for integration scenarios.

Ballerina includes an [extensive standard library](https://v1-0.ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/index.html), which includes not only the usual low-level, general-purpose functionality, but also support for a wide variety of network protocols, interface standards, data formats and authentication/authorization standards, which make writing secure, resilient distributed applications significantly easier than with other languages. Refer to this library if you need more information on these Ballerina modules that are available by default.

Ballerina programs operate on a rich universe of values. Values are of three kinds:

- **Simple values**, like booleans and floating point numbers, which are not constructed from other values;
- **Structured values**, like mappings and lists, which create structures from other values;
- **Behavioral values**, like functions, which allow parts of Ballerina programs to be handled in a uniform way with other values

The following are the values we want to focus on in this document:

- [Some value 1](#Some-value-1)
- [Some value 2](#Some-value-2)
- [Some value 3](#Some-value-3)
- [Some value 4](#Some-value-4)

## Some value 1

Some value 1 is used in the abc scenario.

> **Tip**: Use a blockquote like this to add some tips about Some value 1.

The following is an example of you would use Some value 1:

```ballerina
Sample code here

```

In integration scenario x, we can use Some value 1 to do y. 

The following is an example of how Some value 1 is used to achieve y.

```ballerina
Sample code here

```

## Some value 2

Some value 2 is used in the abc scenario.

> **Tip**: Use a blockquote like this to add some tips about Some value 2.

The following is an example of you would use Some value 2:

```ballerina
Sample code here

```

In integration scenario x, we can use Some value 2 to do y. 

The following is an example of how Some value 2 is used to achieve y.

```ballerina
Sample code here

```

## Some value 3

Some value 3 is used in the abc scenario.

> **Tip**: Use a blockquote like this to add some tips about Some value 3.

The following is an example of you would use Some value 3:

```ballerina
Sample code here

```

In integration scenario x, we can use Some value 3 to do y. 

The following is an example of how Some value 3 is used to achieve y.

```ballerina
Sample code here

```

---

## Some value 4

Some value 4 is used in the abc scenario.

> **Tip**: Use a blockquote like this to add some tips about Some value 4.

The following is an example of you would use Some value 4:

```ballerina
Sample code here

```

In integration scenario x, we can use Some value 4 to do y. 

The following is an example of how Some value 4 is used to achieve y.

```ballerina
Sample code here

```
