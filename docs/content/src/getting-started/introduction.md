# Introduction

WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (EI) 7.0 includes a Ballerina Integrator, which is a powerful code-based approach to integration. 

For developers, the Ballerina-based integration component marks a new phase of integration technology - a powerful, simple-to-learn, code-driven approach to programming integrations. It includes first-class cloud-native functions as well as a graphical sequence diagram tool. Since it is a programming language, integration developers can apply agile methodologies, truly bringing a new degree of speed and agility to integration projects.
