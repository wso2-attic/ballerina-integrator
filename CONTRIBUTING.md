# Contributing to Ballerina Integrator

WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (EI) 7.0 includes a revolutionary new code-driven approach for integration with the Ballerina language, ideal for programming network-distributed applications based on sequence diagram semantics. Since Ballerina is a programming language, developers can now apply agile methodologies to integration for the first time.

We are an open-source project registered under Apache license.
